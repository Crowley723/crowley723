### About Me
I am passionate about cybersecurity and open-source technologies. Currently contributing to Authelia and focusing on authentication systems.
I maintain my own self-hosted infrastructure to practice security principles and privacy-focused solutions.

### Currently Working On
- **Kubernetes Monitoring Setup**: Building a full observability stack with Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir, and Pyroscope on my Kubernetes cluster
  - Using Grafana's monitoring tools to automatically discover and collect logs, metrics, and traces
  - Logs and traces are working great, still troubleshooting the metrics collection
  
- **Automated Kubernetes Node Deployment**: Creating configuration files for Flatcar Linux to easily deploy new Kubernetes nodes
  - Switching from Ubuntu Server to a container-focused OS for cleaner infrastructure
  - Goal: easily replace any node in the cluster without headaches (raise cattle not pets)
  - Running everything on Proxmox across two physical servers

- **Security-Focused Self-Hosting**: Maintaining high security standards in my homelab
  - Contributing improvements to the Authelia sso/identity server
  - Learning and implementing proper authentication and authorization patterns
  - Keeping everything self-hosted with privacy and security as top priorities

### Skills
- Languages: Go, Typescript, C, Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript
- Technologies: React, [Material-UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/)
- Platforms: Linux, Docker, Kubernetes
